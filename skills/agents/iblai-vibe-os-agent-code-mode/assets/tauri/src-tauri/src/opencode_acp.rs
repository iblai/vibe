//! opencode ACP transport for "Coding Mode".
//!
//! Spawns `opencode acp` as a long-lived subprocess per chat session and speaks
//! the Agent Client Protocol (newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio). opencode is
//! configured (via `~/.config/iblai/agents/opencode/opencode.json` +
//! `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) to use ibl.ai's OpenAI-compatible API as its model provider.
//!
//! Agent `session/update` notifications are translated into the SAME Tauri events
//! the chat UI already renders for local models — `ollama:token` / `ollama:done` /
//! `ollama:error` (keyed by `generation_id`) — plus `opencode:reasoning` and
//! `opencode:tool_call` for thinking and tool activity.
//!
//! This is hand-rolled (serde_json + tokio) rather than using the
//! `agent-client-protocol` crate: the ACP surface we need is small and we want
//! precise control over per-delta emit throttling, cancellation, and process reuse
//! — mirroring the existing `ollama_chat_stream` NDJSON loop.
