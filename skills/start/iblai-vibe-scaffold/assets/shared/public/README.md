# Public Assets

This directory contains public assets that are served directly by Next.js.

## env.js

The `env.js` file contains runtime environment variables. This allows environment variables to be injected at Docker container startup time, rather than at build time.

In production, you can use a script to replace the placeholder values with actual environment variables before starting the container.
